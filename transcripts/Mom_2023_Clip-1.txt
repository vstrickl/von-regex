Ma.

00;00;18;38 - 00;00;28;07

Harriet. Hi. How you doing? Daniel? Yeah. Good to see you, too. You ready to do this? Ready?

00;00;28;07 - 00;00;33;12
Unknown
do this. Ready to do this? I'm ready to do it. All right. Ready to get in shape.

00;00;35;00 - 00;00;37;37
Unknown
And so can I have a cocktail first?

00;00;38;52 - 00;00;40;33
Unknown
No, we could do

00;00;40;33 - 00;00;41;29
Unknown
that afterwards.

00;00;41;30 - 00;01;02;56

No cocktails. What is the effect of drinking cocktails or alcohol when working out? Trying to get your body in shape? There are no effective alcohols. That's counter-intuitive. So, too, what you should be doing to get in shape. Okay. How does it affect the muscles? How does that affect the effort? Well, it definitely slows you down.

00;01;02;56 - 00;01;23;52
Unknown
sleep? Studies show that alcohol ruins your sleep and therefore is going to ruin your recovery, too. Okay. All right. So. So what should I do? Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Water. Electrolyte. If you're working out pretty hard and make sure that especially for women, you feel your body before and after you exercise.

00;01;23;57 - 00;01;43;38
Unknown
So there's something that I read, that feeling your body after more than before, according to what your goal is, feeling it with protein within 15 minutes is most effective. Is that true? Well, for women, you want to come into your exercises said so ogling your body is important.

00;01;43;38 - 00;01;49;17
Unknown
Both. It's just as important to feel your body before as it is to feel your body after.

00;01;49;30 - 00;02;13;00
Unknown
So they're equally important and you definitely want to feel your body with protein within 30 to 45 minutes of your exercise. So as soon as you can, if you can get it in right after exercise, get it in right after exercise. Women have a smaller window to get their protein needs. Mix and carbohydrates needs met after exercise. So carbs after exercise are just as important as protein.

00;02;13;12 - 00;02;53;21
Unknown
Okay. What about carbo loading prior to exercise? Carbo loading for women is not as effective because our body metabolizes carbs a little bit differently. So we prioritize our nutrients a little bit differently than men. So check out Dr. Stacy Sims program on Women Are Not Small Men. You'll learn all about nutrition and exercise science for women's needs regardless of what reproductive lifespan you're in, whether you're a pre-teen, prepubescent in your reproductive life, or your reproductive life span is ending.

00;02;53;25 - 00;03;22;16
Unknown
So check out her program. This is where I'm learning all this good stuff. Carbo loading for women doesn't always work the best, but just eating a nice, balanced diet of macronutrients that you do. Okay, so you spoke up before work out. What do you recommend eating prior to a workout and what's the timeline? So usually you want to eat about an hour and a half to 2 hours prior to your workout.

00;03;22;21 - 00;03;43;46
Unknown
But it also depends on everybody digests their food differently. So make sure that you listen to your body and notice how you're feeling right before your workout. If you ate like an hour to 30 minutes prior and you're feeling like you haven't fully digested your food, try to extend that out a little bit more. Pay attention to what you're eating.

00;03;43;50 - 00;04;10;14
Unknown
I notice for me, if I eat too heavily, too much heavy protein before I work out, I kind of feel sluggish. So you still want to have protein, You still want to have carbs before you eat. And if you are a female, you can use app while they either give you all of your portions for your body type to f y the I wild a wild I know just wild wild.

00;04;10;19 - 00;04;33;19
Unknown
Yes. What is that? So that is an app for women that works. It's basically a format. So so you can use it to put in your when your period starts or if you're in perimenopause or menopause and they'll give you all your protein and macronutrient needs. Okay. Thank you.

00;04;41;04 - 00;04;56;36
Unknown
Excited to start working out with me. I am so excited to start working out with you. I've seen some of your work, and I am excited to get someone just like you to push me to my next level. But you're not traumatized from what I took you hiking.

00;04;56;38 - 00;05;00;29
Unknown
I am traumatized. And that's interesting. You brought that up because

00;05;00;29 - 00;05;24;33
Unknown
when we went hiking and it was dry grass with weeds up the hill, weeds are getting in my sock and my ankle now. Yes, I am traumatized. I have PTSD, but something and you help you get over that. It was like, no, it didn't. I didn't continue it. I remember cutting it off.

00;05;24;38 - 00;05;45;00
Unknown
Yeah, but wait, so you're still excited to train with me now? Yeah. Sometimes those hard knocks, those hard moments get you to where you got to go. Yeah, And it was tough. Once you can get over that hump, you achieve your goal. And that's where I'm at with it. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. So you're like, Well, we're just going to grit through it.

00;05;45;04 - 00;05;54;04
Unknown
Yep. It's going to grind through as long as I have some Bengay and Douglas to give me a massage when need it, I think I'll survive.
